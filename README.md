# Human Detection with Transfer Learning (PyTorch + MobileNetV2)

This project demonstrates how to use transfer learning with PyTorch‚Äôs `mobilenet_v2` model to perform human detection with bounding boxes.  
Unlike standard image classification, this work extends into object detection by localizing humans in an image rather than just predicting whether one exists.

## ‚ú® Project Overview
The project was developed as part of a university course on Computer Vision. It is structured as a sequence of assignments (`a1` ‚Üí `a8`), each building on the previous to gradually develop the full detection pipeline:

- ‚úÖ Understanding image preprocessing and data pipelines  
- ‚úÖ Using **MobileNetV2** as a feature extractor  
- ‚úÖ Fine-tuning with transfer learning on a human detection dataset  
- ‚úÖ Implementing bounding box regression in addition to classification  
- ‚úÖ Training and evaluating the detector  
- ‚úÖ Visualizing results with bounding boxes drawn over detections  

The final result is a compact detector that can identify and localize humans in images.
